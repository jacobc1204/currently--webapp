# Currently

I wanted to build a minimal and modern looking app to track how many books I read in a year. So I did.
This is the first actual app that I have built and I am _pretty_ proud of it.
I have a lot of things I would like to do with it in the future as it grows, including mobile apps, which I have already been working on.

I am open to any and all feedback, and if you decide to use the app I hope you like it.

My email is jacob@jacobhcarlton.com.
